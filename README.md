Violet Bui - Data Bootcamp - Module 21 challenge

This analysis seeks to train a neural network model to be able to predict if an applicant for the non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup will be successful with their ventures or not. 
## Data
- <u>[Alphabet Soup Charity Data](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dla-1-2/m21/lms/starter/charity_data.csv)</u>: Data from a non-profit foundation, Alphabet Soup

## Solution
- <u>deepLearning.ipynb</u>: A jupyter notebook which loads in the data and trains a neural network

## Outputs
- <u><b>Deep Learning Challenge Report.docx</u></b>: A report explaining the findings of this analysis
- <u>AlphabetSoupCharity.h5</u>: The first model trained
- <u>AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.h5</u>: Themost optimised model
